          Users are required to evaluate the following considerations, among others, carefully before
          making an investment in the opportunities appearing on this website. Prospective investors
          should give careful consideration to the following actual and potential risk factors in
          evaluating the merits and suitability of an investment in an opportunity appearing herein.
          The risks and facts set forth below are not exhaustive; additional risks and uncertainties
          not presently known, or deemed immaterial with respect to an investment in the opportunity
          may exist. Prospective investors should have the financial ability and willingness to
          accept the risks and lack of liquidity, which are characteristics of the investments
          described herein. There will be no public market for the units of the opportunity.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Because of the uncertainties and subjective judgments inherent in selecting opportunities
          and the assumptions made; and because future events and circumstances cannot be predicted,
          there can be no assurance that the desired expected results of the opportunity will be
          achieved. The actual results may differ materially. In making an investment decision, users
          must rely on their own examination of the opportunity and the terms of the offering,
          including the merits and risks involved.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-900 mt-6 mb-4">Potential Risk Factors</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Data and Forecasts:</strong> Market data and certain industry forecasts used in
            forecasts for an opportunity are obtained from market research, publicly available
            information and industry publications. Industry publications generally state that the
            information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but
            that the accuracy and completeness of that information is not guaranteed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Forward-looking statements:</strong> Investment outcome forecasts are based on
            numerous assumptions, present and future business strategies, and the environment in
            which the opportunity will operate in the future. The actual outcomes may differ
            materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real Estate Ownership in General:</strong> The investments we recommend will be
            subject to the risks generally incident to the ownership, operation, and development of
            real property. Market fluctuations and cycles may result in occasional or permanent
            reductions in the value of the investments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leverage:</strong> The investments in the opportunities currently do not have any
            avenues for leverage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Long-term Investment:</strong> Each investment opportunity will set out a minimum
            lock-in period of anywhere between 3 months to 6 months. Additional periods of time may
            be required for the investments to reach maturity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Illiquidity of Investments:</strong> Purchases of the securities we recommend
            should be considered a long-term investment. Liquidity may not be achieved at the
            projected price at all times, and there is no public market available for the securities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Minority Investment:</strong> Investment in a particular opportunity will
            represent a minority stake that cannot exercise control or exert significant influence on
            the management of the opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>General Macroeconomic Conditions:</strong> Macroeconomic factors such as interest
            rates, inflation, and trade barriers may impact the opportunityâ€™s success and liquidity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Changes in Indian Laws and Regulations:</strong> Legal and regulatory changes
            could occur, adversely affecting the value of the real property or the expenditure of the
            company.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reliance on Asset Manager:</strong> The asset manager provides support in
            accounting, tax, and other administrative services. Limitations on the liability of the
            asset manager and its affiliates are specified in agreements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Operational Risks:</strong> The asset managerâ€™s operations depend on systems that
            may interface with third-party systems, leading to risks that could impact performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Professional Advice:</strong> The company or asset manager urges prospective
            investors to consult their legal, tax, and financial advisers regarding the suitability
            of an investment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Natural or Man-Made Disasters:</strong> Disasters such as floods, pandemics, and
            terrorist acts could negatively affect the performance of the real estate market, thereby
            impacting the opportunity.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-6">
          <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The foregoing risk factors do not purport to be a complete
          explanation of all of the risks involved in the opportunity. Potential investors should
          read this document and the opportunity documents in their entirety before determining the
          risk factors associated with subscribing to the opportunity.
